# Card Game Secretary
## Description
This app helps you to record the scores of various card games. It is my second React app and I am very pleased with my advancement in the React/Redux sphere.

## Latest Changes
I've just finished authentication and the ability to save your friends' names in order to use them every time you play. This is done thanks to Firebase.

## Login
User names are only provided by me. Contact me on the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree channel to get user name and password!
