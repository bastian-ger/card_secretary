# Card Game Secretary
## Description
This app helps you to record the scores of various card games. It is my second React app and I am very pleased with my advancement in the React/Redux sphere.

## Current and Future Work
Currently I'm setting up a connection to Google Firebase for authentication and saving scores and names.
