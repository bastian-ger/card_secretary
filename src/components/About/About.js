      <h1>About this website</h1>
      <p>This website is my second attempt to bring my recently obtained React
      skills to life. Thanks to Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course
      "React 16 - The Complete Guide" on Udemy, I was able to improve my code
      and its structure a lot. Everyone who wants to use React should check out
      this course.</p>
      <p>Furthermore I would like to thank the respective communities and companies who
      developed and maintain these frameworks and libraries...</p>
